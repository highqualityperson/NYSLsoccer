      <h2>Rules of Play + Policies</h2>
      <h4>FIFA rules shall govern NYSL play except as modified herein.</h4>
 </div>
 <div class="rules">
<h3>SPORTSMANSHIP</h3>
    <div class="sportsmanship">
   The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship
    and fair play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from this
    purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical soccer background, expertise, accomplishments or
    standing.</div></div>
<div class="rules"><h3>FIFA FIELD REGULATIONS</h3>
<ol class="rules_ol">
    <li><small>DIMENSIONS.</small> FIFA Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions
    within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams
    under 12 and older.</li>
    
    <li><small>COMPETITION FIELDS.</small> Fields used within the  competitionprogram must be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards. Leagues, districts or
    associations participating in the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these minimum
    requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and
    recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues,
    districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be required to play all their games away.</li>
   
    <li ><small> FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS</small></li>
    <ol type="a">
        <li >U-6 play on a field approximately 20X40 yards with no penalty areas. Fields for older age groups should be progressively larger.</li>
        <li >U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width.</li>
        <li >U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in width.</li>
        <li >In addition,fields used by young age groups may have their internal
        dimensions and size of goal similarly modified.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <li><small>TEAM BENCH AREAS</small>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Recreation & District Programs</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
        <li>The decision for team/spectator placement on the field will
        be made by the governing body of that team. A team’s bench area shall consist of that area at least one (1) yard away
        from the touchline and extending to twenty yards (20) both ways from the halfway line. In the event that field conditions require team benches to be on the same side of the field, a team’s bench area shall consist of that area two
        (2) yards away from the touchline and extending twenty yards one (1) way from the halfway line.</li>
        <li>The home team has first choice as to where it wishes to locate its bench area. Coaches and substitutes are required to
        remain within their bench area during the game. Parents and spectators should occupy the same side of the field as the
        team they are supporting.</li>
    </ul>
